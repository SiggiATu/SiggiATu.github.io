<h1 style="text-align:center;">Building foundation for a block retainer wall<h1>
</div>
<div>
<p>Foundation is necessary for mostly all structures, however, the climate and geography of the area you live in greatly effects the process of builing foundation. In Michigan, due to the cold, it is essential to dig a minimum of 42 inches below your structure to combat the ground's frost during the winter.</p>

<h3>Steps for building a trench footing foundation.</h3>
</div>
<dl>
	<dt>Figure out where your homes gas lines/wires are</dt>
	<dd>- call missdig and get a report on where your homes electrical and gas lines are running in the ground</dd>
	<dt>Mark out the area for your wall</dt>
	<dd>- Spray paint is helpful in this situation</dd>
	<dt>Hand-dig 42 inches below ground level</dt>
	<dd>- If you encounter concrete while digging, get yourself a pickaxe</dd>
	<dt>Mix ready-mix concrete</dt>
	<dd>- a small shovel will be much easier to mix with in the wheelbarrel</dd>
	<dt>Pour concrete into trench footing</dt>
	<dd>- This will take multiple rounds of mixing and pouring</dd>
	<dt>Float the concrete and ensure level</dt>
	<dd>- You can use a hand float or flat trowel, or even a piece of flat lumber to float the wet concrete</dd>
	<dt>Let concrete cool for a few hours before laying</dt>
	<dd>- You might be able to lay even sooner if the weathers hot</dd>

<h4>Sidenote — For overkill, you can drill 4 bar into your home's existsting foundation and hammmer in a few bars before you pour the concrete. But for a small scale structure like a retainer wall, that mostly isn't necessary.</h4>

<div><h2>Step 1: Call MISS DIG (811)<h2></div>
<div>
<p>A free service provided by your utility provider, MISS DIG will come out and mark your public utliity lines before you start digging for your foundation.<p>

<div><h2>Step 2: Mark out/Measure<h2></div>
<div>
<p>Establish where you want your retainer wall. Make appropriate measurements; outlining your project is crucial to ensuring correct function and aesthetic. I highly recommend a tape meausure and a can of pink spray paint<p>
<h4>Tip — All block is 16 inches long: the width is the variable (4/6/8/12 inch). Thus, use your tape measure to measure out in 16 inch increments, accounting for each block, or potential half blocks.</h4>

<div><h2>Step 3: Dig out your trench footing<h2></div>
<div>
<p>This is the laborious part: make sure you dig at least 42 inches below ground level. Try and get an even cut along the trench footing to create a stable foundation.<p>
<h4>Tip — make sure to make the width of the trench footing about 1.5/2 X the width of your actual block, therefore allowing for extra room on the footing when you are laying your block.</h4>

<div><h2>Step 4: Mix concrete; pour trench footing<h2></div>
<div>
<p>You must develop z touch for the concrete. When beginning the mixing process, start by putting a small bucket of water in your wheelbarrel, and then about half a bag of ready mix concrete. Mix that around some, and continue titrating small amounts of concrete and water. You don't have to get too technical with this, as its not the mortar, but make sure your concrete isnt too stiff, nor too loose. You want a moveable-sludge like consistency<p>
<h4>Tip — Use about two bags of ready mix concrete per round. Try and finish the pouring process the same day, as the preparation is rather time consuming.</h4>

<div><h2>Step 5: Float concrete<h2></div>
<div>
<p>As soon as you are done pouring, float the concrete to a leveled, smooth consistency. This is very important, as it is the surface you are laying your block on.<p>
<h4>Tip — Make sure to float the concrete as best you can! The smoother and more level your footing, the easier it will be to lay block. A poor trench footing makes for a terrible blocklaying experience.</h4>
