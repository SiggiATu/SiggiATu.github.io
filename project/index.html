<h2>But first, what is blocklaying?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Blocklaying â€” the art of building with concrete blocks. Blocklaying is one of the many manifestations of masonry: you can lay brick, stone, cultured stone, tiles. In the art of blocklaying, the mason binds two concrete blocks together using mortar. Blocks are primarily touted not for design purposes but for their structural integrity and strength. Blocklayers typically lay block for the foundations of residential homes and even large scale commercial buildings. Block is one of the most commonnly used materials for structural foundation, thus many blocklayers still exist today, building homes and commercial buildings.</p>

		<th>Used to build small scale garages, veneer walls, and also layed on top of preexistin 6 inch block for foundation. 4 Inch block is particularly hard to lay because of its light density.</th>
		<th>Used to build garages, barns, sheds, etc. The "easiest" block to carry around.</th>
		<th>Perhaps the "standard" block, 8 inch block is used for majority of house foundations and other larger scale structures.</th>
		<th>Used primarily for very large commercial jobs, or jobs needing very strong foundation. Not fun to carry around.</th>
