<caption>Led Zeppelin is perhaps the greatest band to ever form in the history of the universe. Although I am a bit biased because they are one of my favorite bands, after many moments of objective reflection, I have to say that, probably along with Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin is one of the greatest bands in musical history. Even today, their sounds still echo with musical genius and brilliance.
What makes them so good? Well, they quite simply are a match made in heaven. In Led Zeppelin, all four members were MASTERS at their craft. John Paul Jones on Bass and keyboard, John Bonham on the drums, Robert Plant as lead vocals and harmonica (sometimes), and the most innovative and methodical guitarist to ever live — Jimmy Paige. The members of Led Zeppelin also shared a tight wound bond and teamwork — you can see it in the performances, as Bonzo levers the beat to Paige's rhythm and licks, while Plant thrusts his hips and screams into Paiges eyes, both of them spasming on stage, while John Paul Jones lingers in the back, orchestrating the foundation with his bass guitar or the keyboard. The albums Led Zeppelin has put out, back to back to back, never ceases to bring new flavor, new aroma, and new juice to the world. Every lyric and sound, every hum is unique, creative, and moves the soul in various ways. Their sounds will live on forever. </caption>
